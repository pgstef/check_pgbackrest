=head2 SERVICES

Descriptions and parameters of available services.

=item B<retention>

Fail when the number of full backups is less than the 
C<--retention-full> argument.

Fail when the newest backup is older than the C<--retention-age> 
argument.

Fail when the newest full backup is older than the 
C<--retention-age-to-full> argument.

The following units are accepted (not case sensitive): s (second), m 
(minute), h (hour), d (day). You can use more than one unit per 
given value.

Arguments are not mandatory to only show some information.

=item B<archives>

Check if all archived WALs exist between the oldest and the latest 
WAL needed for the recovery.

Archives must be compressed. If needed, use "compress-level=0"
instead of "compress=n".

Use the C<--wal-segsize> argument to set the WAL segment size.

The following units are accepted (not case sensitive):
b (Byte), k (KB), m (MB), g (GB), t (TB), p (PB), e (EB) or Z (ZB). Only
integers are accepted. Eg. C<1.5MB> will be refused, use C<1500kB>.

The factor between units is 1024 bytes. Eg. C<1g = 1G = 1024*1024*1024.> 

Use the C<--ignore-archived-before> argument to ignore the archived 
WALs generated before the provided interval. Used to only check the
latest archives.

Use the C<--ignore-archived-after> argument to ignore the archived 
WALs generated after the provided interval.

The C<--latest-archive-age-alert> argument defines the max age of 
the latest archived WAL as an interval before raising a critical 
alert.

The following units are accepted as interval (not case sensitive):
s (second), m (minute), h (hour), d (day). You can use more than 
one unit per given value. If not set, the last unit is in seconds. 
Eg. "1h 55m 6" = "1h55m6s".

All the missing archives are only shown in the C<--debug> mode.

Use C<--list-archives> in addition with C<--debug> to print the list of all the
archived WAL segments.

By default, all the archives older than the oldest backup start archive 
or newer than the max_wal returned by the pgBackRest info command 
are ignored. 

Use the C<--extended-check> argument to force a full check of the found 
archives and raise warnings in case of inconsistencies.

=item B<check_pgb_version>

Check if this script is running a given version.

You must provide the expected version using C<--target-version>.
