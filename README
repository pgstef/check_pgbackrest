NAME
    check_pgbackrest - pgBackRest backup check plugin for Nagios and Zabbix (for zabbix integration, see zabbix subfolder)

SYNOPSIS
      check_pgbackrest [-s|--service SERVICE] [-S|--stanza NAME]
      check_pgbackrest [-l|--list]
      check_pgbackrest [--help]

DESCRIPTION
    check_pgbackrest is designed to monitor pgBackRest (2.33 and above)
    backups from Nagios and Zabbix.

    -s, --service SERVICE
        The Nagios service to run. See section SERVICES for a description of
        available services or use "--list" for a short service and
        description list.

    -S, --stanza NAME
        Name of the stanza to check.

    --repo REPOSITORY
        Repository index to operate on. If no "--repo" argument is provided,
        the service will operate on all repositories defined, checking for
        inconsistencies across multiple repositories. When using multiple
        repositories, it is recommended to also define checks using the
        "--repo" argument to verify the sanity of each repository
        separately.

    -O, --output OUTPUT_FORMAT
        The output format. Supported outputs are: "human", "json", "nagios"
        (default), "nagios_strict" and "prtg".

        The "nagios_strict" output format will filter out unsupported types
        of values from the performance data.

    -C, --command FILE
        pgBackRest executable file (default: "pgbackrest").

    -c, --config CONFIGURATION_FILE
        pgBackRest configuration file.

    -P, --prefix COMMAND
        Some prefix command to execute the pgBackRest info command (eg:
        "sudo -iu postgres").

    -l, --list
        List available services.

    --debug
        Print some debug messages.

    -V, --version
        Print version and exit.

    -?, --help
        Show this help page.

  SERVICES
    Descriptions and parameters of available services.

    retention
        Fail when the number of full backups is less than the
        "--retention-full" argument.

        Fail when the number of differential backups is less than the
        "--retention-diff" argument.

        Fail when the number of incremental backups is less than the
        "--retention-incr" argument.

        Fail when the newest backup is older than the "--retention-age"
        argument.

        Fail when the newest full backup is older than the
        "--retention-age-to-full" argument.

        Fail when the oldest backup is newer than the
        "--retention-age-to-oldest" argument.

        The following units are accepted (not case sensitive): s (second), m
        (minute), h (hour), d (day). You can use more than one unit per
        given value.

        Arguments are not mandatory to only show some information.

    archives
        Check if all archived WALs exist between the oldest and the latest
        WAL needed for the recovery.

        Use the "--wal-segsize" argument to set the WAL segment size.

        The following units are accepted (not case sensitive): b (Byte), k
        (KB), m (MB), g (GB), t (TB), p (PB), e (EB) or Z (ZB). Only
        integers are accepted. Eg. "1.5MB" will be refused, use "1500kB".

        The factor between units is 1024 bytes. Eg. "1g = 1G =
        1024*1024*1024."

        Use the "--ignore-archived-before" argument to ignore the archived
        WALs generated before the provided interval. Used to only check the
        latest archives.

        Use the "--ignore-archived-after" argument to ignore the archived
        WALs generated after the provided interval.

        The "--latest-archive-age-alert" argument defines the max age of the
        latest archived WAL as an interval before raising a critical alert.

        The following units are accepted as interval (not case sensitive): s
        (second), m (minute), h (hour), d (day). You can use more than one
        unit per given value. If not set, the last unit is in seconds. Eg.
        "1h 55m 6" = "1h55m6s".

        All the missing archives are only shown in the "--debug" mode.

        Use "--list-archives" in addition with "--debug" to print the list
        of all the archived WAL segments.

        Use "--list-boundaries" in addition with "--debug" to print the list
        of all the boundary WAL segments fetched from the history files.

        By default, all the archives older than the oldest backup start
        archive or newer than the max_wal returned by the pgBackRest info
        command are ignored.

        Use the "--extended-check" argument to force a full check of the
        found archives and raise warnings in case of inconsistencies.

        When WAL archives on different timelines are found, .history files
        are parsed to find the switch point and define the boundary WAL.

        Use the "--max-archives-check-number" to prevent infinite WAL
        archives check when boundary WAL can't be defined properly.

        In case of pgBackRest db history change (after a successful
        stanza-upgrade), only the latest db system/version will be checked.

    check_pgb_version
        Check if this script is running a given version.

        You must provide the expected version using "--target-version".
